(3,'Kansas','Fusing the complexity of British prog rock with an American heartland
sound representative of their name, Kansas were among the most popular bands of the
late ''70s; though typically dismissed by critics, many of the group''s hits remain
staples of AOR radio play lists to this day. Formed in Topeka in 1970, the founding
members of the group -- guitarist Kerry Livgren, bassist Dave Hope, and drummer
Phil Ehart -- first played together while in high school; with the 1971 addition of
classically trained violinist Robbie Steinhardt, they changed their name to White
Clover, reverting back to the Kansas moniker for good upon the 1972 arrivals of
vocalist/keyboardist Steve Walsh and guitarist Richard Williams. The group spent
the early part of the decade touring relentlessly and struggling for recognition;
initially, their mix of boogie and prog rock baffled club patrons, but in due time
they established a strong enough following to win a record deal with the Kirshner
label.
Kansas'' self-titled debut LP appeared in 1974; while only mildly successful, the
group toured behind it tirelessly, and their fan base grew to the point that their
third effort, 1975''s Masque, sold a quarter of a million copies. In 1976,
Leftoverture truly catapulted Kansas to stardom. On the strength of the smash hit
"Carry On Wayward Son," the album reached the Top Five and sold over three million
copies. 1977''s Point of Know Return was even more successful, spawning the monster
hit "Dust in the Wind." While the 1978 live LP Two for the Show struggled to break
the Top 40, its studio follow-up, Monolith, the band''s first self-produced effort,
reached the Top Ten. That same year, Walsh issued a solo record, Schemer-Dreamer.
In the wake of 1980''s Audio-Visions, Kansas began to splinter; both Hope and
Livgren became born-again Christians, the latter issuing the solo venture Seeds of
Change, and their newfound spirituality caused divisions within the band''s ranks.
Walsh soon quit to form a new band, Streets; the remaining members forged on
without him, tapping vocalist John Elefante as his replacement. The first Kansas LP
without Walsh, 1982''s Vinyl Confessions, launched the hit "Play the Game Tonight,"
but after only one more album, 1983''s Drastic Measures, they disbanded. In 1986,
however, Kansas re-formed around Ehart, Williams, and Walsh; adding the famed
guitarist Steve Morse as well as bassist Billy Greer, the refurbished band debuted
with the album Power, scoring a Top 20 hit with "All I Wanted." When the follow-up,
1988''s In the Spirit of Things, failed to hit, seven years passed before the
release of their next effort, Freaks of Nature. Always Never the Same followed in
1998. Seeing the return of founder singer/songwriter Kerry Livgren, Somewhere to
Elsewhere was released in 2000. Jason Ankeny.',NULL,'www.kansasband.com',NULL),

formed in 1960. Primarily the band consisted of John Lennon (rhythm guitar,
vocals), Paul McCartney (bass guitar, vocals), George Harrison (lead guitar,
vocals) and Ringo Starr (drums, vocals). Throughout their career, The Beatles are
recognised for leading the mid-1960s musical "British Invasion" into the United
States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and
homegrown skiffle, the group explored genres ranging from Tin Pan Alley to
psychedelic rock. Their clothes, styles, and statements made them trend-setters,
while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and
cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four
members embarked upon solo careers.

Beyoncé, is an American R&B singer-songwriter, record producer, and actress. Born
and raised in Houston, Texas, she enrolled in various performing arts schools, and
was first exposed to singing and dancing competitions as a child. Knowles rose to
fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of girl group Destiny''s Child, the best-
selling girl group of all time.
After a series of commercial successes with the group, Knowles released her debut
solo album, Dangerously in Love, in June 2003. The album became one of the most-
successful albums of that year, spawning the number-one singles "Crazy in Love" and
"Baby Boy". It earned Knowles five Grammy Awards in a single night in 2004, and its
reception signaled her viability as a solo artist. The disbandment of Destiny''s
Child in 2005 facilitated her continued success, she released her second album,
B''Day, in 2006, which spawned the UK number-one singles "Déjà Vu" and "Beautiful
Liar", and the worldwide hit "Irreplaceable". Knowles will release her third solo
album titled I Am... Sasha Fierce on November 18, 2008. Knowles has sold over 63
million albums worldwide, including album sales in with Destiny''s Child.
The success of her solo albums has established Knowles as one of the most
marketable artists in the industry. She has added acting and endorsement deals to
her repertoire. In 2006, she starred in the comedy film The Pink Panther, and, in
the same year, scored the main role in the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway
musical Dreamgirls, which earned her a Golden Globe nomination. Knowles launched in
2004 her family''s fashion line, House of Deréon, and among her many lucrative
commercial deals are Pepsi, Tommy Hilfiger, and L''Oréal. Knowles has been with
boyfriend Jay-Z since 2002, though they have been discreet about their
relationship. After much speculation, they married on April 4, 2008.',

(7,'Atlanta Rhythm Section','Often described as a more radio-friendly version of
Lynyrd Skynyrd or the Allman Brothers, the Atlanta Rhythm Section was one of many
Southern rock bands to hit the upper reaches of the charts during the late ''70s.
Hailing from the small town of Doraville, Georgia, the beginning of the Atlanta
Rhythm Section can be traced back to 1970. It was then that a local recording
studio was opened, Studio One, and the remnants of two groups (the Candymen and the
Classics Four), became the studio''s house band. One of the facility''s head
figures, Buddy Buie, soon began assembling the session band -- singer Rodney Justo,
guitarist Barry Bailey, bassist Paul Goddard, keyboardist Dean Daughtry, and
drummer Robert Nix. After playing on several artists'' recordings, it was decided
to take the band a step further and make the group of players a real band, leading
to the formation of the Atlanta Rhythm Section.

(8,'Lynyrd Skynyrd','Lynyrd Skynyrd was the definitive Southern rock band, fusing
the overdriven power of blues-rock with a rebellious Southern image and a hard rock
swagger. Skynyrd never relied on the jazzy improvisations of the Allman Brothers.
Instead, they were a hard-living, hard-driving rock & roll band -- they may have
jammed endlessly on-stage, but their music remained firmly entrenched in blues,
rock, and country. For many, Lynyrd Skynyrd''s redneck image tended to obscure the
songwriting skills of their leader, Ronnie Van Zant. Throughout the band''s early
records, Van Zant demonstrated a knack for lyrical detail and a down-to-earth
honesty that had more in common with country than rock & roll. During the height of
Skynyrd''s popularity in the mid-''70s, however, Van Zant''s talents were
overshadowed by the group''s gritty, greasy blues-rock. Sadly, it wasn''t until he
was killed in a tragic plane crash in 1977 along with two other bandmembers that
many listeners began to realize his talents. Skynyrd split up after the plane
crash, but they reunited a decade later, becoming a popular concert act during the
early ''90s. ',NULL,'www.lynyrdskynyrd.com',NULL),

spite of critical pans and somewhat reluctant radio airplay (at first), Grand Funk
Railroad built a devoted fan base with constant touring, a loud, simple take on the
blues-rock power trio sound, and strong working-class appeal. The band was formed
by Flint, MI, guitarist/songwriter Mark Farner and drummer Don Brewer, both former
members of a local band called Terry Knight & the Pack. They recruited former ? &
the Mysterians bassist Mel Schacher in 1968, and Knight retired from performing to
become their manager, naming the group after Michigan''s well-known Grand Trunk
Railroad.
They performed for free at the 1969 Atlanta Pop Festival, and their energetic, if
not technically proficient, show led Capitol Records to sign them at once. While
radio shied away from Grand Funk Railroad, the group''s strong work ethic and
commitment to touring produced a series of big-selling albums over the next few
years; five of their eight releases from 1969 to 1972 went platinum, and the others

(12,'Boston','The arena rock group behind one of the fastest-selling debut albums
in history, Boston was essentially the vehicle of studio wizard Tom Scholz, born
March 10, 1947, in Toledo, OH. A rock fan throughout his teen years, he began
writing songs while earning a master''s degree at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. After graduation, he began work for Polaroid, and set about
constructing his own 12-track recording studio in the basement of his home, where
demos were recorded that earned Scholz and vocalist Brad Delp a contract with Epic
in 1975. Although some recording and overdubs were later done in Los Angeles, the
1976 release of Boston consisted largely of tapes recorded in Scholz''s basement.
(By then, the lineup had coalesced around Scholz, Delp, guitarist Barry Goudreau,
bassist Fran Sheehan, and drummer John "Sib" Hashian.) Boston spawned three hit
singles ("More Than a Feeling," "Long Time," and "Peace of Mind"), and shot
immediately to the top of the charts, remaining the best-selling pop debut effort
in history before it was supplanted by Whitney Houston''s first album in 1986.
Despite the record''s overwhelming success, Scholz spent over two years working on
the follow-up, 1978''s number one hit Don''t Look Back; a perfectionist, he only
then released the album because of intense label pressure for product. Unsatisfied
with the results, he swore to produce the next album at his own pace; as a result,
the chart-topping Third Stage did not appear until 1986, at which time only Scholz
and Delp remained from the original

(18,'Little River Band','When Little River Band formed in 1975, Australia
immediately took notice. The key bandmembers were already well known to
Australians. Lead singer Glenn Shorrock had made his name in mid-''60s group the
Twilights, a Beatles-sounding pop group that scored a national number one record
with its version of the Velvelettes'' "Needle in a Haystack." When the group broke
up in 1969, Shorrock became lead singer of Axiom, whose "A Little Ray of Sunshine"
is still an Australian classic rock staple. LRB''s Beeb Birtles had been the bass
player for a popular Twilights-era pop group called Zoot (Rick Springfield was a
later member). When that group broke up, in search of musical credibility, Birtles
auditioned as the bass player, but was instantly elevated to a front-line position
alongside Graham Goble. Even LRB''s manager was well-known. Glenn Wheatley had been
the bassist with another of Australia''s bands, and possibly its most legendary,
the Masters Apprentices. Given all that background, when Shorrock and Birtles
revealed they were forming a group with Goble, managed by Wheatley, it was major
event in Australian music.
They had all had a shot at international stardom via England, without success.
Little River Band were formed to conquer the world from Australia via America. With
that in mind, they almost immediately went into the studio, even before the rest of
the band had been consolidated. They were retaining Mississippi drummer Derek
Pellicci and were on the lookout for a guitarist and a bass player. A very early
version of the group recorded the Everly Brothers'' "When Will I Be Loved" as a
single, a recording that was shelved when Linda Ronstadt also happened to choose
that song as a single. The blueprint for Little River Band was country-rock as
practiced by exponents like the Eagles.
Their self-titled first album was released in November 1975. The following May they
released a second album, After Hours, and in September of that year set off on
their first trip overseas to support Queen at Hyde Park and the Average White Band
in the U.S. to promote the release of the first album. Its eight-and-a-half-minute
epic "It''s a Long Way There" had been edited down for release as a single and was
starting to make quite an impact. Graham Goble had written the song about the long
trip taking his laundry back to his mother in Adelaide from Melbourne. To an
America in shock after the Nixon presidency, the song took on a whole other
dimension. LRB had made a big breakthrough. Their American record company decided
that the second album, After Hours, was too dark, and put the band straight into
the studio to record the next album, resolving to use some of the After Hours
tracks and the best of what was being recorded for the band''s third Australian
album. In both forms the result was called Diamantina Cocktail, produced by John
Boylan (Linda Ronstadt). ',NULL,'www.littleriverband.com',NULL),
(20,'Fleetwood Mac','Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band, formed in
London in 1967. The band have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making
them one of the world''s best-selling bands. In 1998, selected members of Fleetwood
Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received the Brit Award
for Outstanding Contribution to Music.
Fleetwood Mac were founded by guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick Fleetwood and
guitarist Jeremy Spencer. They lacked a permanent bass guitarist for the first few
months before Green convinced John McVie to join, establishing the first stable
line-up in time to record their first album. Danny Kirwan joined as a third
guitarist in 1969, and keyboardist Christine Perfect, who was used as a session
musician starting with the second album, later married John McVie and joined the
band in 1970. During this time period, the band was primarily a British blues
outfit, scoring a UK number one with "Albatross"; and had lesser hits with the
singles "Oh Well" and "Black Magic Woman". Personal problems led to original
guitarists Green and Spencer leaving in short order, replaced by Bob Welch and Bob
Weston.
In late 1974, while the band was scouting studios in Los Angeles, they were
introduced to folk-rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. The band sought to
add Buckingham as their new lead guitarist, who agreed under the condition that
Nicks, his singing partner and girlfriend at the time, also would join the band.
The addition of Buckingham and Nicks caused the band to take on a more pop rock
sound, with their 1975 album Fleetwood Mac becoming their best selling record to
date, reaching No. 1 in the US. Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac''s second album after
the incorporation of Buckingham and Nicks, produced four US Top 10 singles and
remained at No. 1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching
the top spot in various countries around the world. The album has sold over 40
million copies worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-selling album to date.
During the recording of Rumours, the band went through personal turmoil, as both of
the romantic partnerships in the band (John & Christine McVie and Buckingam &
Nicks) separated, though the band kept making music together.
The lineup remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s
the band began to disintegrate. First to leave was Buckingham, followed by Nicks in
1991, to be replaced by a series of short-term guitarists and vocalists. In 1993, a
one-off performance for the Presidential Inauguration of Bill Clinton featured the
five key members back together for the first time in six years, and by 1997, a full
reunion occurred. In 1998, Christine McVie retired from touring, and the band
stayed together as a four-piece with John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, Lindsey
Buckingham, and Stevie Nicks. In 2014, Christine McVie rejoined again full time.
The latest studio album by the band was 2003''s Say You Will, though a side project

After a return to college to focus on her studies, Hesketh along with two of her

(101,'Bruce Springsteen','Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born
September 23, 1949) is an American songwriter, singer and guitarist. He has
recorded
and toured with the E Street Band. Springsteen is widely known for his brand of
heartland
rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered
around his
native New Jersey. His eloquence in expressing ordinary, everyday problems has
earned
him numerous awards, including eighteen Grammy Awards and an Academy Award, along
with a notoriously dedicated and devoted global fan base. His most famous albums,
Born to
Run and Born in the U.S.A., epitomize his penchant for finding grandeur in the
struggles
of daily life. He has sold over 65 mil lion albums in the U.S, and 120 mil lion
worldwide.
Springsteen has long had the nickname The Boss, a term which he was initially
reported
to hate but now seems to have come to terms with, as he sometimes jokingly refers
to himself as such on stage. The nickname originated when a young Springsteen,
playing club gigs with a band in the 1960s, took on the task of collecting the
band''s nightly pay and
distributing it amongst his bandmates.',NULL,'www.brucespringsteen.net','1949-09-23');
